# Number Confusion

![Explanation](concern.png)
_why did i even make this_

## Setup

To change which caches are scrambled, change
the values in `ai.arcblroth.numberconfusion.Owo`.

Then run the project and watch as extremely subtle bugs manifest.
Or not so subtle ones.

## Disclaimer

Arc'blroth guarantees that the JVM will most likely crash.
Tested with Hotspot and JetBrains Runtime. If anyone
would like to test this on OpenJDK feel free to.
